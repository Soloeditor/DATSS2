            <h3 class="n3">Dr. Comfort Walker</h3>
            <p class="d1">Our founder Dr. Walker has broad experience in dealing with various disabilities. Dr. Walker received her Doctorate in Education, specializing in International Education, from Northcentral University, Masters. in Special Education, with specialization in Low Incidence Disabilities from Kean University, and Bachelors from Kean University in Special Education and Elementary K-6.  

                Dr. Walker has worked as a teacher in various school settings in New Jersey. 
                
                She is the winner of the 2017 and 2022 Thumbs Up Awards. DCF Regional School Recognized her contributions to supporting and educating students with disabilities. Dr. Walker comprehends that working with this group of students effectively requires time, love, patience, skills, and energy to identify individual learning needs and understand that two students with the same disabilities require a distinctly different approach.
                
                Dr. Walker feels incredibly blessed in her teaching career opportunities by working with many exceptional students of all ages. She believes it is her calling to teach students with disabilities and share the insights she has gained over the years with other teachers. 
                
                Over time, Dr. Walker has become increasingly aware that Parents, teachers, Caretakers, Care Teams, organizations, and schools working with students with disabilities often lack the support they require from their communities to support their students effectively.
                
                DATSS seeks to help meet those needs. </p>
